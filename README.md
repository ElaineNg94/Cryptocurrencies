# Cryptocurrencies
The purpose of this analysis was to help Martha discover trends that will convince her firm to invest in these new cryptocurrencies. We both know about Bitcoin and its popularity which caused a price jump and made it unaffordable to new investors, but there are other cryptocurrencies which are more affordable.  I used unsupervised machine learning for this, which is different from supervised machine learning because unsupervised machine learning has no known output and is used to find groups and patterns in my data. Unsupervised machine learning uses input data only, which is why thereâ€™s no known output. I also had to process the data to be able to use an unsupervised model, then group the data together by using clustering and the K-means algorithm. After that, I made my model more efficient by doing principle component analysis (PCA).
